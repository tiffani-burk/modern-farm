//steps
//1.define and export a plantSeeds function 
//2. The function must accept the year's planting plan yearlyPlan as input (i.e. it must define a parameter).
//3.The plan is an array. It contains 4 arrays representing the rows in the field to be plants. Figure out how to iterate both the parent array and the child arrays.
//4. As you iterate the row of food types to be planted, invoke the corresponding factory function (e.g. if the food type is "Asparagus", invoke the createAsparagus function to get an asparagus seed).
//5. Take that seed and add it to the array of plants in the field module.


// define and export a function 
export const plantSeeds = (yearlyPlan) => {
    for (seed of plantSeeds) {
        if ()
    }
}
